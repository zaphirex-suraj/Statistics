    "### Question 1: What is the difference between descriptive statistics and inferential statistics? Explain with examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptive and inferential statistics are two main branches of statistical analysis, each serving a different purpose in data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Descriptive Statistics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptive statistics summarize and describe the essential features of a data set. They present raw data in a meaningful way through numerical calculations, graphs, and tables. These statistics help us understand patterns within the data without making generalizations or predictions beyond the data at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common tools:** Measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode), measures of dispersion (range, variance, standard deviation), data visualizations (bar charts, histograms, pie charts).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** A teacher calculates the average score of her 30 students in a math test. Mean = 75; Highest = 98; Lowest = 45 — this is a descriptive summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inferential Statistics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Inferential statistics are used to make predictions or generalizations about a population based on data collected from a sample. It uses probability theory to draw conclusions and test hypotheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common tools:** Hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, regression analysis, chi-square tests, ANOVA.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** A researcher surveys 200 people to estimate the average income in a city of 500,000 people. Based on this sample the researcher estimates the average income is ₹25,000 per month — this is an inference to the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comparison (brief):**\n",
    "- Purpose: descriptive = describe observed data; inferential = infer about a larger population.\n",
    "- Data scope: descriptive uses the dataset available; inferential uses a sample to generalize.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:** Descriptive statistics summarize what we have; inferential statistics help make educated guesses about what we do not have (the full population)."

    "### Question 2: What is sampling in statistics? Explain the differences between random and stratified sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sampling** is the process of selecting a subset (sample) from a larger group (population) to make statistical inferences. It helps make data collection manageable and cost-effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Random (Simple Random) Sampling:**\n",
    "- Each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected.\n",
    "- Reduces selection bias when the population is homogeneous.\n",
    "- Example: picking 50 students at random from a college list using random numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stratified Sampling:**\n",
    "- The population is divided into subgroups (strata) based on shared characteristics (e.g., gender, age). A sample is taken from each stratum (proportionally or equally).\n",
    "- Ensures representation of subgroups and often gives more precise estimates when population is heterogeneous.\n",
    "- Example: If a company has 60 men and 40 women and we want a sample of 20, pick 12 men and 8 women proportionally.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comparison:**\n",
    "- Random sampling is simpler; stratified helps ensure subgroup representation and can reduce variance when groups differ.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:** Choose random sampling when population is relatively uniform; choose stratified sampling when important subgroups must be represented."

    "### Question 3: Define mean, median, and mode. Explain why these measures of central tendency are important.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mean (Average):** Sum of all values divided by the number of observations.\n",
    "- Example: For marks 70,75,80,85,90 → mean = 80.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Median:** The middle value when the data are sorted. If even number of observations, median is the average of two middle values.\n",
    "- Example: 15,20,25,30,35 → median = 25. For 10,20,30,40 → median = (20+30)/2 = 25.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mode:** The value that appears most frequently. A dataset can be unimodal, bimodal, multimodal, or have no mode.\n",
    "- Example: 5,8,8,10,12 → mode = 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Importance:**\n",
    "- Mean gives a general average used widely (income, temperature, marks).\n",
    "- Median is robust to outliers and skewed distributions (useful for income data).\n",
    "- Mode identifies the most common value (useful for popular product size, category).\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these three measures together helps summarize different aspects of a dataset's central tendency depending on data shape and presence of outliers."

    "### Question 4: Explain skewness and kurtosis. What does a positive skew imply about the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Skewness:** Measures asymmetry of a distribution.\n",
    "- Symmetric (skewness ≈ 0): mean = median = mode.\n",
    "- Positive skew (right-skewed): long right tail, mean > median > mode; indicates some unusually large values.\n",
    "- Negative skew (left-skewed): long left tail, mean < median < mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Positive skew implication:** Most data concentrated on left; a few large values pull the mean to the right. Example: income distributions commonly show positive skew.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Kurtosis:** Measures 'tailed-ness' or peakedness of a distribution.\n",
    "- Mesokurtic: similar to normal (reference).\n",
    "- Leptokurtic: high peak and fat tails (more extreme values/outliers).\n",
    "- Platykurtic: flatter peak and thinner tails (fewer extremes).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use:** Skewness tells about symmetry; kurtosis indicates likelihood of outliers. Both are useful in risk assessment and understanding distributional shape."
